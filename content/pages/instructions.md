Title: Push Instructions

#### What are Push Instructions?

An instruction is a function that has access to the items on the stacks, and can push its result on to any of the stacks.

Consider this python implementaion of the `integer_add` instruction.

```python
def integer_add(state):
    if len(integer stack of state) > 1:
        i = top integer + second integer.
        pop integer stack of state.
        pop integer stack of state.
        push i onto integer stack of stack.
```

Notice that nothing happens to the `state` if there are insufficient arguements to the instruction.
